And because 
google_fonts >=4.0.5 
depends on http 
^1.0.0, 
http_interceptor 
^1.0.2 is 
incompatible with 
google_fonts >=4.0.5.
So, because 
flota_mobile depends 
on both google_fonts 
^6.1.0 and 
http_interceptor 
^1.0.2, version 
solving failed.


You can try one of 
the following 
suggestions to make 
the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your 
constraint on 
http_interceptor: 
flutter pub add http_
interceptor:^2.0.0
* Consider 
downgrading your 
constraint on 
google_fonts: 
flutter pub add 
google_fonts:^4.0.4
