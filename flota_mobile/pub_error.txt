Resolving dependencies...
Because no versions of firebase_messaging match >16.1.1 <17.0.0 and firebase_messaging 16.1.1 depends on firebase_core_platform_interface ^6.0.2, firebase_messaging ^16.1.1 requires firebase_core_platform_interface ^6.0.2.
And because cloud_firestore >=4.10.0 <5.0.1 depends on firebase_core_platform_interface ^5.0.0, firebase_messaging ^16.1.1 is incompatible with cloud_firestore >=4.10.0 <5.0.1.
So, because flota_mobile depends on both firebase_messaging ^16.1.1 and cloud_firestore ^4.15.4, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try an upgrade of your constraints: flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
