Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        
Warning: Flutter support for your project's Gradle version (8.5.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Gradle version to a version of at least 8.7.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at C:\Users\USER\Desktop\giga\flota_mobile\android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. 
For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html.

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.2.1) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\USER\Desktop\giga\flota_mobile\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\USER\Desktop\giga\flota_mobile\android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".
