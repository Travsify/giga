flutter : Warning: 
Flutter support for 
your project's 
Android Gradle 
Plugin version 
(Android Gradle 
Plugin version 
8.5.0) will soon be 
dropped. Please 
upgrade your Android 
Gradle Plugin 
version to a version 
of at least Android 
Gradle Plugin 
version 8.6.0 soon.

Alternatively, use 
the flag "--android-s
kip-build-dependency-
validation" to 
bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's AGP 
version is typically 
defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` 
file (C:\Users\USER\D
esktop\giga\flota_mob
ile\android/settings.
gradle), by a plugin 
with the id of com.an
droid.application. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an 
older template 
version. In this 
case it is most 
likely defined in 
the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:
\Users\USER\Desktop\g
iga\flota_mobile\andr
oid/build.gradle) by 
the following line 
in the dependencies 
block of the 
buildscript: 
"classpath 'com.andro
id.tools.build:gradle
:<version>'".
